    <h3>Original question on Reddit</h3>
    <p>
        Hi,

        I'm trying to gather 4 clusters of points to 4 points, each at the center of the cluster.

        I'm already working with openCV, so I tried to do this with kmeans function, but didn't succeeded so far..

        In a nutshell:

        I have the following points.

    <h2 id="grainsofrice">Challenge - How many grains of rice are in the picture?</h2>
    <img src="images/HowManyRiceGrains.jpg" />
    <h3>Original question</h3>
    <p>
        I need to calculate the size distribution of particles/objects present in the image. One way is to find the contours and calculate the size distribution. But due to overlapping particles the contours are not coming properly.
        Can someone suggest some preprocessing methods to apply on these kind of images for finding contours or some other method to calculate the size distribution of objects present in the image.

        What is the best approach to recognize the voucher number (digits) in pictures like these?.
        I only need to extract the digits under "PIN Code"

    <h2 id="segmentbacteria">Challenge - Segment these colonies of bacteria</h2>
    <img src="images/ColoniesImageSegmentation.jpg" />
    <h3>Original question</h3>
    <p>
        Hello,

        I work with bacteria. I grow co-cultures of them, imaging over time, and use image analysis to detect the colonies and separate them. My workflow, which is

        <ul>
            <li>1. background subtract</li>
            <li>2a. smooth</li>
            <li>2b. find a global threshold over time</li>
            <li>3. z-project thresholded images over time</li>
            <li>4. find peaks in image from 3</li>
            <li>5. invert image from 3, impose minima at peaks, and watershed to separate</li>
        </ul>

        works really well when only one species is present. However, when two species are present (like in the linked image), the watershed separation sucks.
        Does anyone have suggestions on how to properly separate these?

        It's important to note that getting the areas correct is important. I say this because I've tried using k-means on the color values, which does work pretty well. However, it also assigns the dim parts of the bright colonies to the dim colony species. Unfortunately, I can't just toss these rings, because actual area measurements are important.
